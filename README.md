# nubbys-forgery-example-mod
Example mod for [Nubby's Forgery](https://github.com/skirlez/nubbys-forgery), a modloader for Nubby's Number Factory.

All of the code here is public domain - you are free to copy or fork it, change and do whatever you want, without attribution.

Nubby's Forgery has a modular structure, and doesn't force you to have anything other than a `mod.json` and a `mod.meow`/`mod.gml`. This example mod showcases just one potential way to structure your mod.
For more information, see this [wiki page](https://github.com/Skirlez/nubbys-forgery/wiki/Mod-Structure-and-Loading).

If you want to make a new mod, I would recommend downloading this repository / forking it using git if you know how, and placing it in your mods folder.
If you don't want to use git, press the green `<> Code` button on this page, and press Download ZIP.
